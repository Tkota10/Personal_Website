**Abstract:**

In an effort to identify nearby and unusual cold objects in the solar neighborhood, we searched for previously unidentified moving objects using CatWISE2020 proper motion data combined with machine learning methods. We paired the motion candidates with their counterparts in 2MASS, UHS, and VHS. Then we searched for white dwarf, brown dwarf, and subdwarf outliers on the resulting color-color diagrams. This resulted in the discovery of 16 new dwarfs including two nearby M dwarfs (< 30 pc), a possible young L dwarf, a high motion early T dwarf and 3 later T dwarfs. This research represents a step forward in completing the census of the Sun's neighbors.
